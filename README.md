## Description

2048 is a popular puzzle game where you combine tiles with the same number to reach the ultimate goal of creating a tile with the number 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, and you can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. New tiles with the number 2 or 4 appear on the grid after each move.

This implementation of 2048 is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it accessible and playable in any modern web browser.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles in the respective direction.
- Tiles with the same number will merge into one when they collide.
- The game ends when you cannot make any more moves, either because the grid is full, or you cannot combine any more tiles.
- Your objective is to reach the 2048 tile, but don't stop there; see if you can achieve an even higher score!

## Features
